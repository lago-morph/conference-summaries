# Requirements Review Process

**⚠️ ONE-TIME TASK DOCUMENTATION - DO NOT READ FOR CONTEXT**
*This directory contains documentation for a specific one-time review process completed in December 2024. Future AI agents should ignore this directory as it is not relevant for ongoing project context.*

## Purpose

This directory contains the working documents for processing feedback from three AI model reviews of the conference data extraction system:
- claude_opus_review.md
- google_gemini_pro_3.md  
- gpt_codex_5_1.md

## Objective

Systematically review all issues and recommendations from these three sources to:
1. Consolidate and categorize all feedback
2. Resolve conflicts between different reviewers
3. Make informed decisions about each issue
4. Update existing specification documents
5. Create a repository for future ideas that are out of current scope

## Process

The review process involves four phases:
1. **Analysis and Consolidation** - Extract and organize all issues
2. **Decision Framework Setup** - Create templates for decision tracking
3. **Systematic Review** - Go through each issue with documented reasoning
4. **Implementation** - Update specs and create future ideas repository

## Target Documents for Updates

- `specs/requirements.md`
- `specs/conference-extractor/requirements.md`
- `specs/conference-extractor/implementation-context.md`
- `specs/future-analytics/requirements.md`
- `specs/future-analytics/requirements-context.md`

## Outcome

A comprehensive decision journal capturing:
- What issues were identified
- How conflicts were resolved
- Why each decision was made
- What updates were applied to specifications
- What ideas were deferred for future consideration

This ensures no valuable feedback is lost while maintaining clear reasoning for all decisions made during the review process.
